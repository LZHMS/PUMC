## Project Structure
+ Data Demonstration:
    + The data used in this project is from the website of the 2024 MCM/ICM contest. `data` folder includes the raw data files and processed indicators, as well as the results(`graphD`) from SPSS software.
+ Codes Demonstration: 
    + The codes of `codes.ipynb` includes all codes used in this project from the big data processing to model and solve the problems. You can easily run the codes to get the results. 
+ Images Demonstration: 
    + This folder stores all images our team had done. Considering the size of notebook file and transition efficiency, I cleared all results shall be shown in notebook. Instead, I saved these results under this folder which explained the model and algorithm very well.
